  abstract = {Background Many countries are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19, driven predominantly by the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. In response, these countries are considering the administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the delta variant. We aimed to use the data repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Using data from Clalit Health Services, which provides mandatory health-care coverage for over half of the Israeli population, individuals receiving a third vaccine dose between July 30, 2020, and Sept 23, 2021, were matched (1:1) to demographically and clinically similar controls who did not receive a third dose. Eligible participants had received the second vaccine dose at least 5 months before the recruitment date, had no previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had no contact with the health-care system in the 3 days before recruitment. Individuals who are health-care workers, live in long-term care facilities, or are medically confined to their homes were excluded. Primary outcomes were COVID-19-related admission to hospital, severe disease, and COVID-19-related death. The third dose effectiveness for each outcome was estimated as 1\hphantom{,}\textendash\hphantom{,}risk ratio using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Findings 1\hphantom{,}158\hphantom{,}269 individuals were eligible to be included in the third dose group. Following matching, the third dose and control groups each included 728\hphantom{,}321 individuals. Participants had a median age of 52 years (IQR 37\textendash 68) and 51\% were female. The median follow-up time was 13 days (IQR 6\textendash 21) in both groups. Vaccine effectiveness evaluated at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose, compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago, was estimated to be 93\% (231 events for two doses vs 29 events for three doses; 95\% CI 88\textendash 97) for admission to hospital, 92\% (157 vs 17 events; 82\textendash 97) for severe disease, and 81\% (44 vs seven events; 59\textendash 97) for COVID-19-related death. Interpretation Our findings suggest that a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective in protecting individuals against severe COVID-19-related outcomes, compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago.

  abstract = {The success of the World Health Organization smallpox eradication program three decades ago resulted in termination of routine vaccination and consequent decline in population immunity. Despite concerns regarding the reintroduction of smallpox, there is little enthusiasm for large-scale redeployment of licensed live vaccinia virus vaccines because of medical contraindications and anticipated serious side effects. Therefore, highly attenuated strains such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are under evaluation in humans and animal models. Previous studies showed that priming and boosting with MVA provided protection for {$>$}2 years in a monkeypox virus challenge model. If variola virus were used as a biological weapon, however, the ability of a vaccine to quickly induce immunity would be essential. Here, we demonstrate more rapid immune responses after a single vaccination with MVA compared to the licensed Dryvax vaccine. To determine the kinetics of protection of the two vaccines, macaques were challenged intravenously with monkeypox virus at 4, 6, 10, and 30 days after immunization. At 6 or more days after vaccination with MVA or Dryvax, the monkeys were clinically protected (except for 1 of 16 animals vaccinated with MVA), although viral loads and number of skin lesions were generally higher in the MVA vaccinated group. With only 4 days between immunization and intravenous challenge, however, MVA still protected whereas Dryvax failed. Protection correlated with the more rapid immune response to MVA compared to Dryvax, which may be related to the higher dose of MVA that can be tolerated safely.},

Studies of animal models, serologic testing, and pipeline vaccines were excluded. Eligible studies were evaluated by definition of exposure; attempts to distinguish pre- and postexposure effects were rated on a scale of 1 to 4. We screened 4,518 articles and ultimately identified for this review 14 clinical trials and 31 observational studies spanning 7 of the 28 vaccine-preventable diseases. For secondary attack rate, the following medians were found for postexposure vaccination effectiveness: hepatitis A, 85\% (interquartile range (IQR), 28; n~=~5 sources); hepatitis B, 85\% (IQR, 22; n~=~5 sources); measles, 83\% (IQR, 21; n~=~8 sources); varicella, 67\% (IQR: 48; n~=~9 sources); smallpox, 45\% (IQR, 39; n~=~4 sources); and mumps, 38\% (IQR, 7; n~=~2 sources). For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the median vaccine postexposure efficacies were 100\% (IQR, 0; n~=~6 sources) and 63\% (IQR, 50; n~=~8 sources), respectively. Many available vaccines can modify or preclude disease if administered after exposure. This postexposure effectiveness could be important to consider during vaccine trials and while developing new vaccines.},

Animals vaccinated with a single immunization of Imvamune were not protected completely from severe and/or lethal infection, whereas those receiving either a prime and boost of Imvamune or a single immunization with Acam2000 were protected completely. Additional parameters, including clinical observations, radiographs, viral load in blood, throat swabs, and selected tissues, vaccinia virus-specific antibody responses, immunophenotyping, extracellular cytokine levels, and histopathology were assessed. There was no significant difference (P {$>$} 0.05) between the levels of neutralizing antibody in animals vaccinated with a single immunization of Acam2000 (132 U/ml) and the prime-boost Imvamune regime (69 U/ml) prior to challenge with monkeypox virus. After challenge, there was evidence of viral excretion from the throats of 2 of 6 animals in the prime-boost Imvamune group, whereas there was no confirmation of excreted live virus in the Acam2000 group. This evaluation of different human smallpox vaccines in cynomolgus macaques helps to provide information about optimal vaccine strategies in the absence of human challenge studies.},

  abstract = {Background: The Women's Health Initiative randomized trial found greater coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in women assigned to estrogen/progestin therapy than in those assigned to placebo. Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users. Methods: Using data from the observational Nurses' Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of "trials," in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy. Results: The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92\textendash 2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78\textendash 1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61\textendash 1.14) in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84\textendash 1.48) in the others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The HRs were 1.61 (0.97\textendash 2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66\textendash 1.49) for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19\textendash 1.51) in women within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78\textendash 1.84) in others (P value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between these estimates and previously reported Nurses' Health Study estimates. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between the Women's Health Initiative and Nurses' Health Study ITT estimates could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and length of follow-up.},

  abstract = {Decades after public health interventions \textendash{} including pre- and post-exposure vaccination \textendash{} were used to eradicate smallpox, zoonotic orthopoxvirus outbreaks and the potential threat of a release of variola virus remain public health concerns. Routine prophylactic smallpox vaccination of the public ceased worldwide in 1980, and the adverse event rate associated with the currently licensed live vaccinia virus vaccine makes reinstatement of policies recommending routine pre-exposure vaccination unlikely in the absence of an orthopoxvirus outbreak. Consequently, licensing of safer vaccines and therapeutics that can be used post-orthopoxvirus exposure is necessary to protect the global population from these threats. Variola virus is a solely human pathogen that does not naturally infect any other known animal species. Therefore, the use of surrogate viruses in animal models of orthopoxvirus infection is important for the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Major complications involved with the use of surrogate models include both the absence of a model that accurately mimics all aspects of human smallpox disease and a lack of reproducibility across model species. These complications limit our ability to model post-exposure vaccination with newer vaccines for application to human orthopoxvirus outbreaks. This review seeks to (1) summarize conclusions about the efficacy of post-exposure smallpox vaccination from historic epidemiological reports and modern animal studies; (2) identify data gaps in these studies; and (3) summarize the clinical features of orthopoxvirus-associated infections in various animal models to identify those models that are most useful for post-exposure vaccination studies. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide observations and comments regarding available model systems and data gaps for use in improving post-exposure medical countermeasures against orthopoxviruses.},

  abstract = {The protection provided by smallpox vaccines when used after exposure to Orthopoxviruses is poorly understood. Postexposu re administration of 1st generation smallpox vaccines was effective during eradication. However, historical epidemiological reports and animal studies on postexposure vaccination are difficult to extrapolate to today's populations, and 2nd and 3rd generation vaccines, developed after eradication, have not been widely tested in postexposure vaccination scenarios. In addition to concerns about preparedness for a potential malevolent reintroduction of variola virus, humans are becoming increasingly exposed to naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxviruses and, following these exposures, disease severity is worse in individuals who never received smallpox vaccination. This study investigated whether postexposure vaccination of prairie dogs with 2nd and 3rd generation smallpox vaccines was protective against monkeypox disease in four exposure scenarios. We infected animals with monkeypox virus at doses of 104 pfu (2\texttimes{} LD50) or 106 pfu (170\texttimes{} LD50) and vaccinated the animals with IMVAMUNE\textregistered{} or ACAM2000\textregistered{} either 1 or 3 days after challenge. Our results indicated that postexposure vaccination protected the animals to some degree from the 2\texttimes{} LD50, but not the 170\texttimes{} LD5 challenge. In the 2\texttimes{} LD50 challenge, we also observed that administration of vaccine at 1 day was more effective than administration at 3 days postexposure for IMVAMUNE\textregistered, but ACAM2000\textregistered{} was similarly effective at either postexposure vaccination time-point. The effects of postexposure vaccination and correlations with survival of total and neutralizing antibody responses, protein targets, take formation, weight loss, rash burden, and viral DNA are also presented.},

  abstract = {On July 23, 2022, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, declared the current monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), overriding the WHO Emergency Committee, which decided 6-9 against recommending a PHEIC.  That decision was justified, with cases in more than 70 countries, most of which are nonendemic, many with no clear epidemiological links and milder nonspecific clinical presentation. The window for controlling monkeypox is closing and a well-funded global plan for containment is needed.},

  abstract = {Between April 28 and June 22, 1972, 1384 smallpox cases and 372 deaths were detected in Khulna Municipality, Bangladesh. Within three weeks of instituting surveillance and containment activities the entire city-wide epidemic was under control. Active surveillance detected over 84\% of all new cases, as estimated by dividing the number of cemetery registered ``pox'' burials by the observed case fatality rate. Ninety per cent of family contacts of detected cases were vaccinated in the course of three home visits. Only 75\% were vaccinated at the time of the first visit, but intrafamilial transmission essentially ceased at that time. The secondary attack rate among families first visited within one week of onset of their index case was 1.2\%, compared with 22.2\% for those first visited after five or more weeks had elapsed. Few if any individuals vaccinated as late as five days into their incubation period developed clinical disease. Vaccination performed after that time still reduced the clinical attack rate, on the average, by 50\%. These results suggest that selective epidemiologic control can be highly effective in aborting intense urban smallpox epidemics, and that the search of cemetery burial registers is a useful means of reconstructing the actual course of an epidemic and determining the thoroughness of case detection.},

  abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced in 1972, has become the default approach for survival analysis in randomized trials. The Cox model estimates the ratio of the hazard of the event or outcome of interest (eg, death) between 2 treatment groups. Informally, the hazard at any given time is the probability of experiencing the event of interest in the next interval among individuals who had not yet experienced the event by the start of the interval. Because the Cox model requires the hazards in both groups to be proportional, researchers are often asked to ``test'' whether hazards are proportional.},
