  abstract = {Background Many countries are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19, driven predominantly by the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. In response, these countries are considering the administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the delta variant. We aimed to use the data repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Using data from Clalit Health Services, which provides mandatory health-care coverage for over half of the Israeli population, individuals receiving a third vaccine dose between July 30, 2020, and Sept 23, 2021, were matched (1:1) to demographically and clinically similar controls who did not receive a third dose. Eligible participants had received the second vaccine dose at least 5 months before the recruitment date, had no previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had no contact with the health-care system in the 3 days before recruitment. Individuals who are health-care workers, live in long-term care facilities, or are medically confined to their homes were excluded. Primary outcomes were COVID-19-related admission to hospital, severe disease, and COVID-19-related death. The third dose effectiveness for each outcome was estimated as 1\hphantom{,}\textendash\hphantom{,}risk ratio using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Findings 1\hphantom{,}158\hphantom{,}269 individuals were eligible to be included in the third dose group. Following matching, the third dose and control groups each included 728\hphantom{,}321 individuals. Participants had a median age of 52 years (IQR 37\textendash 68) and 51\% were female. The median follow-up time was 13 days (IQR 6\textendash 21) in both groups. Vaccine effectiveness evaluated at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose, compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago, was estimated to be 93\% (231 events for two doses vs 29 events for three doses; 95\% CI 88\textendash 97) for admission to hospital, 92\% (157 vs 17 events; 82\textendash 97) for severe disease, and 81\% (44 vs seven events; 59\textendash 97) for COVID-19-related death. Interpretation Our findings suggest that a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective in protecting individuals against severe COVID-19-related outcomes, compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago.

  abstract = {Background: The test-negative design is an increasingly popular approach for estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE) due to its efficiency. This review aims to examine published test-negative design studies of VE and to explore similarities and differences in methodological choices for different diseases and vaccines. Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline, for studies reporting the effectiveness of any vaccines using a test-negative design. We screened titles and abstracts, and reviewed full texts to identify relevant articles. We created a standardized form for each included article to extract information on the pathogen of interest, vaccine(s) being evaluated, study setting, clinical case definition, choices of cases and controls, and statistical approaches used to estimate VE. Results: We identified a total of 348 articles, including studies on VE against influenza virus (n=253), rotavirus (n=48), pneumococcus (n=24), and nine other pathogens. Clinical case definitions used to enroll patients were similar by pathogens of interest but the sets of symptoms that defined them varied substantially. Controls could be those testing negative for the pathogen of interest, those testing positive for non-vaccine type of the pathogen of interest, or a subset of those testing positive for alternative pathogens. Most studies controlled for age, calendar time, and comorbidities. Conclusions: Our review highlights similarities and differences in the application of the test-negative design that deserve further examination. If vaccination reduces disease severity in breakthrough infections, particular care must be taken in interpreting vaccine effectiveness estimates from test-negative design studies.},

  abstract = {The success of the World Health Organization smallpox eradication program three decades ago resulted in termination of routine vaccination and consequent decline in population immunity. Despite concerns regarding the reintroduction of smallpox, there is little enthusiasm for large-scale redeployment of licensed live vaccinia virus vaccines because of medical contraindications and anticipated serious side effects. Therefore, highly attenuated strains such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) are under evaluation in humans and animal models. Previous studies showed that priming and boosting with MVA provided protection for {$>$}2 years in a monkeypox virus challenge model. If variola virus were used as a biological weapon, however, the ability of a vaccine to quickly induce immunity would be essential. Here, we demonstrate more rapid immune responses after a single vaccination with MVA compared to the licensed Dryvax vaccine. To determine the kinetics of protection of the two vaccines, macaques were challenged intravenously with monkeypox virus at 4, 6, 10, and 30 days after immunization. At 6 or more days after vaccination with MVA or Dryvax, the monkeys were clinically protected (except for 1 of 16 animals vaccinated with MVA), although viral loads and number of skin lesions were generally higher in the MVA vaccinated group. With only 4 days between immunization and intravenous challenge, however, MVA still protected whereas Dryvax failed. Protection correlated with the more rapid immune response to MVA compared to Dryvax, which may be related to the higher dose of MVA that can be tolerated safely.},

For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the median vaccine postexposure efficacies were 100\% (IQR, 0; n~=~6 sources) and 63\% (IQR, 50; n~=~8 sources), respectively.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}When using observational data, quantifying the effect of treatment duration on survival outcomes is not straightforward because only people who live for a long time can receive treatment for a long time. This problem doesn't apply to randomised trials because people are classified based on the treatment duration they are assigned, rather than the treatment duration that they achieve. This approach accepts that dead people do not deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. By transferring this insight to the analysis of observational data, we can follow three steps to estimate the effect of treatment duration from observational data without the bias of naive comparisons between long term and short term users. The first step is cloning people to assign them to multiple treatment strategies. The second step is censoring clones when they deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. The third step is performing inverse probability weighting to adjust for the potential selection bias introduced by censoring. The procedure can be used to compare any treatment strategies that are sustained over time. Cloning, censoring, and weighting eliminates immortal time bias in the estimates of absolute and relative risk, which helps researchers focus their attention on other biases that may be present in observational analyses and are not so easily eliminated.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users. Methods: Using data from the observational Nurses' Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of "trials," in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy. Results: The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92\textendash 2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78\textendash 1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61\textendash 1.14) in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84\textendash 1.48) in the others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The HRs were 1.61 (0.97\textendash 2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66\textendash 1.49) for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19\textendash 1.51) in women within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78\textendash 1.84) in others (P value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between these estimates and previously reported Nurses' Health Study estimates. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between the Women's Health Initiative and Nurses' Health Study ITT estimates could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and length of follow-up.},

  abstract = {Decades after public health interventions \textendash{} including pre- and post-exposure vaccination \textendash{} were used to eradicate smallpox, zoonotic orthopoxvirus outbreaks and the potential threat of a release of variola virus remain public health concerns. Routine prophylactic smallpox vaccination of the public ceased worldwide in 1980, and the adverse event rate associated with the currently licensed live vaccinia virus vaccine makes reinstatement of policies recommending routine pre-exposure vaccination unlikely in the absence of an orthopoxvirus outbreak. Consequently, licensing of safer vaccines and therapeutics that can be used post-orthopoxvirus exposure is necessary to protect the global population from these threats. Variola virus is a solely human pathogen that does not naturally infect any other known animal species. Therefore, the use of surrogate viruses in animal models of orthopoxvirus infection is important for the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Major complications involved with the use of surrogate models include both the absence of a model that accurately mimics all aspects of human smallpox disease and a lack of reproducibility across model species. These complications limit our ability to model post-exposure vaccination with newer vaccines for application to human orthopoxvirus outbreaks. This review seeks to (1) summarize conclusions about the efficacy of post-exposure smallpox vaccination from historic epidemiological reports and modern animal studies; (2) identify data gaps in these studies; and (3) summarize the clinical features of orthopoxvirus-associated infections in various animal models to identify those models that are most useful for post-exposure vaccination studies. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide observations and comments regarding available model systems and data gaps for use in improving post-exposure medical countermeasures against orthopoxviruses.},

  abstract = {The protection provided by smallpox vaccines when used after exposure to Orthopoxviruses is poorly understood. Postexposu re administration of 1st generation smallpox vaccines was effective during eradication. However, historical epidemiological reports and animal studies on postexposure vaccination are difficult to extrapolate to today's populations, and 2nd and 3rd generation vaccines, developed after eradication, have not been widely tested in postexposure vaccination scenarios. In addition to concerns about preparedness for a potential malevolent reintroduction of variola virus, humans are becoming increasingly exposed to naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxviruses and, following these exposures, disease severity is worse in individuals who never received smallpox vaccination. This study investigated whether postexposure vaccination of prairie dogs with 2nd and 3rd generation smallpox vaccines was protective against monkeypox disease in four exposure scenarios. We infected animals with monkeypox virus at doses of 104 pfu (2\texttimes{} LD50) or 106 pfu (170\texttimes{} LD50) and vaccinated the animals with IMVAMUNE\textregistered{} or ACAM2000\textregistered{} either 1 or 3 days after challenge. Our results indicated that postexposure vaccination protected the animals to some degree from the 2\texttimes{} LD50, but not the 170\texttimes{} LD5 challenge. In the 2\texttimes{} LD50 challenge, we also observed that administration of vaccine at 1 day was more effective than administration at 3 days postexposure for IMVAMUNE\textregistered, but ACAM2000\textregistered{} was similarly effective at either postexposure vaccination time-point. The effects of postexposure vaccination and correlations with survival of total and neutralizing antibody responses, protein targets, take formation, weight loss, rash burden, and viral DNA are also presented.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such non-causal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biological laboratory experiments\textemdash the use of ``negative controls''\textemdash is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish two types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

If, conditional on the history of the observed data up to t, the hazard of dropping out of the study (i.e., censoring) at time t does not depend on the possibly unobserved data subsequent to t, we say drop-out is ignorable or explainable (Rubin, 1976). On the other hand, if the hazard of drop-out depends on the possibly unobserved future, we say drop-out is non-ignorable or, equivalently, that there is selection bias on unobservables. Neither the existence of selection bias on unobservables nor its magnitude is identifiable from the joint distribution of the observables. In view of this fact, we argue that the data analyst should conduct a ``sensitivity analysis'' to quantify how one's inference concerning an outcome of interest varies as a function of the magnitude of non-identifiable selection bias.},

  abstract = {As with many chronic illnesses, recurrent prostate cancer generally requires sustained treatment to prolong survival. However, initiating treatment immediately after recurrence may negatively impact quality of life without any survival gains. Therefore, we consider sustained strategies for initiating treatment based on specific characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which can indicate disease progression. We define the protocol for a target trial comparing treatment strategies based on PSA doubling time, in which androgen deprivation therapy is initiated only after doubling time decreases below a certain threshold. Such a treatment strategy means the timing of treatment initiation (if ever) is not known at baseline, and the target trial protocol must explicitly specify the frequency of PSA monitoring until the threshold is met, as well as the duration of treatment. We describe these and other components of a target trial that need to be specified in order for such a trial to be emulated in observational data. We then use the parametric g-formula and inverse-probability weighted dynamic marginal structural models to emulate our target trial in a cohort of prostate cancer patients from clinics across the United States.},

Within three weeks of instituting surveillance and containment activities the entire city-wide epidemic was under control. Active surveillance detected over 84\% of all new cases, as estimated by dividing the number of cemetery registered ``pox'' burials by the observed case fatality rate. Ninety per cent of family contacts of detected cases were vaccinated in the course of three home visits. Only 75\% were vaccinated at the time of the first visit, but intrafamilial transmission essentially ceased at that time. The secondary attack rate among families first visited within one week of onset of their index case was 1.2\%, compared with 22.2\% for those first visited after five or more weeks had elapsed. Few if any individuals vaccinated as late as five days into their incubation period developed clinical disease. Vaccination performed after that time still reduced the clinical attack rate, on the average, by 50\%. These results suggest that selective epidemiologic control can be highly effective in aborting intense urban smallpox epidemics, and that the search of cemetery burial registers is a useful means of reconstructing the actual course of an epidemic and determining the thoroughness of case detection.},

  abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced in 1972, has become the default approach for survival analysis in randomized trials. The Cox model estimates the ratio of the hazard of the event or outcome of interest (eg, death) between 2 treatment groups. Informally, the hazard at any given time is the probability of experiencing the event of interest in the next interval among individuals who had not yet experienced the event by the start of the interval. Because the Cox model requires the hazards in both groups to be proportional, researchers are often asked to ``test'' whether hazards are proportional.},

  abstract = {Immortal time is a span of cohort follow-up during which, because of exposure definition, the outcome under study could not occur. Bias from immortal time was first identified in the 1970s in epidemiology in the context of cohort studies of the survival benefit of heart transplantation. It recently resurfaced in pharmacoepidemiology, with several observational studies reporting that various medications can be extremely effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These studies, while using different cohort designs, all involved some form of immortal time and the corresponding bias. In this paper, the author describes various cohort study designs leading to this bias, quantifies its magnitude under different survival distributions, and illustrates it by using data from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The author shows that for time-based, event-based, and exposure-based cohort definitions, the bias in the rate ratio resulting from misclassified or excluded immortal time increases proportionately to the duration of immortal time. The bias is more pronounced with a decreasing hazard function for the outcome event, as illustrated with the Weibull distribution compared with a constant hazard from the exponential distribution. In conclusion, observational studies of drug benefit in which computerized databases are used must be designed and analyzed properly to avoid immortal time bias.},

  abstract = {Researchers are often interested in estimating the effect of sustained use of a pharmacological treatment on a health outcome. However, adherence to strict treatment protocols can be challenging for patients in practice and, when non-adherence is expected, estimates of the effect of sustained use may not be useful for decision making. As an alternative, more relaxed treatment protocols which allow for periods of time off treatment (i.e. grace periods) have been considered in pragmatic randomized trials and observational studies. In this paper we consider the interpretation, identification, and estimation of treatment strategies which include grace periods. We contrast natural grace period strategies which allow individuals the flexibility to take treatment as they would naturally do, with stochastic grace period strategies in which the investigator specifies the distribution of treatment utilization. We estimate the effect of initiation of a thiazide diuretic or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in hypertensive patients under various strategies which include grace periods. We find that the risk of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes is higher under treatment with ACEIs, and that this difference is larger under grace period strategies which impose lower drug utilization.},
